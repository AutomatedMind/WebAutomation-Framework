Imagine you're building a house.
The base of the house is the most important part, right?
It holds everything up, and every room in the house depends on it to stay stable.
Without a solid foundation, the whole house could fall apart.

Now, think of your tests as rooms in this house.
Each room (test) has its own purpose, but they all need that strong base to stand on.
In automation testing, the base class is like that foundation.
It’s where you put all the common things that your tests need—things that are used in every test,
like:
Setting up the environment – This is where you decide which browser to use (Chrome, Firefox, etc.),
and you set it up for testing.

Launching the application – Every test needs to visit the website or app you're testing,
so you put this action in the base class so it doesn’t need to be repeated.

Setting up reports and logs – You want to track what happened in each test (whether it passed or failed),
so the base class handles this for all tests.

Closing the browser – Once a test finishes, you need to close the browser.
This too is something you do in every test, so it’s in the base class.

Now, every test you write (like the rooms in the house) can just “inherit” or use this base class.
This means, instead of repeating all those steps in every single test,
you simply use the base class. It’s like saying,
“Hey, I don’t have to tell you how to build the foundation each time. Just use what’s already there!”

So, in short:
The base class is the foundation that makes your tests easier to write, maintain, and run.
It holds common actions like opening the browser, launching the app, logging, and closing the browser,
so you don’t repeat them in every test.
Your actual tests (rooms) just use this base and focus on what they need to do,
like clicking buttons or checking results.

Imagine you’re hosting a party,
and you need to prepare certain things before and after the event,
like setting up the decorations and cleaning up after everyone leaves.
You don’t need to remind yourself to do these tasks for every single guest, right?
They’re common tasks that should happen every time, but you can automate them.

Hooks in testing work in a similar way. They are special actions that run before or after your tests,
and they help prepare or clean up everything for the test execution.
You don’t have to mention them in every test because they’re handled automatically for you.

Here’s how it works:

Before Hook: Think of this like setting up for your party. Before the test starts, you might want to:
Set up the environment (e.g., open a browser).
Launch the application you’re testing.
Set up any necessary configurations (like logging or reporting).
This happens before your test runs, so your test starts with everything ready.

After Hook: Now, after the party, you need to clean up, right? This is like the after hook.
After the test finishes, you might want to:
Close the browser.
Clean up or reset any changes made during the test.
Log the results or generate reports.

Why Hooks?: Instead of repeating the setup and cleanup steps in each of your tests
(which would be time-consuming and messy), hooks take care of it for you automatically. They help you:

Run the same setup and cleanup code before and after every test, without writing it each time.
Keep your tests clean and focused on the specific actions they need to perform.
So, just like preparing for and cleaning up after a party,
hooks ensure everything is ready before your test starts and clean after it ends.
They save time and make your tests more organized and easier to maintain!

To sum up:
Before hooks help you prepare the environment for the test.
After hooks help clean up after the test.
Hooks make sure these actions are done automatically and consistently, without you needing to repeat them in every test.
